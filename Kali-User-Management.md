# 👤 Kali Linux User Management

This guide walks through **basic user management** tasks in Kali Linux, including creating a new user, giving them sudo privileges, changing file ownership, and setting file permissions.  
These are foundational Linux admin skills you’ll use constantly in real-world environments.

## 👤 Add a New User

Create a new user with `adduser`. You’ll be asked to set a password and fill out optional info (full name, phone, etc.). Press **Enter** to skip fields and confirm with **Y**.

```bash
sudo adduser student
```

## 🔑 Grant Sudo Privileges

Add the new user to the **sudo group** so they can run admin commands.  
Check groups to confirm.

```bash
sudo usermod -aG sudo student
groups student
```

## 📂 File Ownership

Only the file’s owner (or root) can modify it. Use `ls -l` to check ownership.  
Example: root owns `example.txt`.

```bash
ls -l
```

Change ownership to `student`:

```bash
sudo chown student:student example.txt
ls -l
```

## 🔒 File Permissions

Use `chmod` to change access.  
Example: `600` means **owner has read/write, others have no access**.

```bash
sudo chmod 600 example.txt
ls -l
```

## 🔄 Switching Users

Switch to the new user with `su - student`.  
Check who you are with `whoami`.  
Exit to return to your main account.

```bash
su - student
whoami
exit
```
